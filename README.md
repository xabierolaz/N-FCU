# N-FCU: Autonomous Takeoff and Landing in Variable Wind Conditions

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the **Neural Flight Control Unit (N-FCU)**, a project that enables autonomous takeoff and landing of drones in challenging variable-wind environments. This work forms part of a doctoral thesis at the **Public University of Navarre (UPNA)**, aiming to enhance UAV robustness and reliability.

## Project Overview

The N-FCU employs advanced **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** techniques to train a neural network controller capable of handling complex aerodynamic disturbances caused by wind. Unlike traditional PID controllers, which often struggle in dynamic and unpredictable conditions, the N-FCU adapts its control policy to maintain stability and precision during critical flight phases.

This repository contains the code, trained models, and experimental data generated throughout the project, promoting **open science** and **reproducibility**.

## PID Takeoff Performance in Variable Wind (1 m/s â€“ 8 m/s)

The GIFs below highlight the limitations of a tuned PID controller during takeoff as wind speed increases.

## Key Features of N-FCU

- **Reinforcement Learning-Based Control**: Utilises PPO and DDPG for adaptive, robust flight control.  
- **Realistic Wind Modelling**: High-fidelity stochastic wind model with gusts and altitude-dependent profiles.  
- **Modular Architecture**: Includes an Adaptation Module that accelerates training and inference.  
- **Optimised Reward Functions**: Custom rewards mitigate issues such as the *Cobra Effect* during takeoff and landing.  
- **Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) Validation**: Demonstrated promising sim-to-hardware transfer.  
- **Novel Metric**: Introduces *Relative Wind Capability (CRV)* to quantify UAV robustness against wind.  
- **Open Source**: Full code and resources are available for research and development.  

## Installation and Usage

Step-by-step instructions for setting up the simulation, training the N-FCU, and running experiments will be provided in the `docs/` folder. This will cover installation of **ROS**, **Gazebo**, and all required **Python dependencies**.
